<h1>Brain Damage Songtext</h1>
${line1}<br>
${line1}<br>
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs<br>
Got to keep the loonies on the path<br>
<br>
${line2}<br>
The lunatics are in my hall<br>
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor<br>
And every day the paperboy brings more<br>
<br>
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon<br>
And if there is no room upon the hill<br>
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too<br>
${darkSide}<br>
<br>
${line3}<br>
${line3}<br>
You raise the blade, you make the change<br>
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane<br>
You lock the door<br>
And throw away the key<br>
There's someone in my head but it's not me<br>
<br>
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear<br>
You shout and no one seems to hear<br>
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes<br>
${darkSide}<br>
